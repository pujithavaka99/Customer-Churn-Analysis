# Customer Churn Analysis

# Project Overview

In this project, I analyzed a Telco customer dataset to understand the key reasons behind customer churn. The objective was to identify patterns that lead to customer attrition and present the insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

Python was used for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis, while Power BI was used to build the dashboard. DAX measures were created to calculate key performance indicators such as churn rate and customer metrics.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Power BI
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – for KPI calculations

## Dataset
Telecom customer churn dataset containing customer demographics, services, and account information.

## Project Steps
1. Data Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Churn Pattern Identification
4. Dashboard Creation in Power BI
5. Created DAX measures for key metrics like churn rate and customer counts

## Key Insights
- Customers with month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rate.
- Higher monthly charges are associated with increased churn.
- Customers without tech support or online security are more likely to churn.
- Electronic check payment users show higher churn rates.

## DAX Measures Used
- Churn Rate
- Total Customers
- Churned Customers
- Active Customers

## Recommendations
- Encourage long-term contracts with incentives.
- Offer bundled services like tech support and online security.
- Create retention offers for high-charge customers.
